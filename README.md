# Bob Fluid Translator
This mod is a bridge between NTM's fluid system and Forge's fluid system: it aims to make these two compatible.

### How do I use it in game?
Check out the wiki in this GitHub repo.

### How does it work?
When the game loads, the mod reads all fluids defined by NTM and creates a corresponding fluid using Forge's fluid API. This means that Bob Fluid Translator should be compatible with any version/fork of NTM.
